# XCITER
A little website that enables batch XCI to NSP file conversions by simple drag and drop.

Based on [4NXCI](https://github.com/The-4n/4NXCI) by The-4n.

## Usage Notes
Click [here](https://andweeb.github.io/xciter) and drop in a keyset file expected by 4NXCI along with the XCI files you want as NSPs and click *Convert*.

Due to browser limitations, the maximum individual XCI file size is 1.5GB, but multiple 1.5GB (or smaller) XCI files can be uploaded and processed at a time.
